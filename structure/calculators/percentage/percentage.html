      <p>A percentage calculator is a tool that allows you to perform mathematical calculations involving percentages.
        This type of calculator can be used for a wide range of applications, from basic arithmetic to more advanced
        calculations such as figuring out discounts, interest rates, and more.

        One of the most common uses for a percentage calculator is to determine the percentage of a number. For example,
        if you want to know what 25% of 100 is, you would input 25 and 100 into the calculator, and the calculator would
        give you the answer of 25. This type of calculation is useful for determining discounts, tax rates, and other
        scenarios where you need to know what a certain percentage of a number is.

        Another common use for a percentage calculator is to find the percentage increase or decrease between two
        numbers. For example, if the price of a product increases from $50 to $60, you can use a percentage calculator
        to determine the percentage increase of the product.

        A percentage calculator can also be used to figure out the original number when you only know the percentage and
        the final number. This can be helpful when trying to figure out the original price of a discounted item or the
        original interest rate before it was increased.

        In addition to the traditional hand-held calculators, there are many online percentage calculators that can be
        accessed easily via a web browser. They are user-friendly, fast and easy to use. Most of them are free to use
        and require no registration.

        In summary, a percentage calculator is a useful tool for performing a wide range of mathematical calculations
        involving percentages. It can be used for determining discounts, tax rates, percentage increase or decrease, and
        more. With the availability of online percentage calculators, it is now more convenient than ever to perform
        these types of calculations.</p>
